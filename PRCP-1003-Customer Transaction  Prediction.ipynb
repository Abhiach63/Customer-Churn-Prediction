Threshold tuning helped balance this trade-off and choose a business-appropriate decision boundary."],"metadata":{"id":"7AlVx1nexuVx"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#Conclusion\n","\n","XGBoost proved to be the most effective and practical model for this banking dataset. With proper imbalance handling and threshold tuning, it provides reliable performance and is suitable for real-world deployment."],"metadata":{"id":"GsifX9oOyOY4"}}]}
